This directory is designated for the data used by the examples
provided with ITKTubeTK.

The data must be downloaded from
   https://data.kitware.com/#folder/58a3abaa8d777f0721a65b0a
prior to running any of the example scripts.

There are several options for downloading that data:

1) Visit the website, use the selector box in the upper left to select
all items in that folder, and then use the selector box to download
all of the selected items into this folder (in your ITKTubeTK source,
build, or installation tree).

2) Install girder-client
   > pip install girder-client
and then run one of the following two scripts:
   > DownloadExampleData.sh
  or
   > python DownloadExampleData.py

Enjoy!
