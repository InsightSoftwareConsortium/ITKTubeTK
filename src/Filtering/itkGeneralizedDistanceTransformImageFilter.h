/** \class GeneralizedDistanceTransformImageFilter
*
* This filter computes a generalized variant of the distance transform with
* a squared euclidean metric. It can optionally compute a voronoi map as
* well.
*
* DEFINITION
* For a scalar function f, the generalized distance transform is defined as
*   dt_f( x ) = min_p{( p-x )^2 + f( x )}
*
* If S is a foreground shape and we use an indicator function
*   i( x ) = 0 if x \in S, \infinity otherwise
* then dt_i is the usual distance transform with a squared euclidean
* distance.
*
* APPLICATION
* The generalization is useful to create the union of spheres with different
* radis, for example. If r is a radius map and f( x ) = -r( x )^2, then the
* <=0 level set of dt_f is the union of all spheres implied by the radius
* map.  This can be used in the context of group morphology with spherical
* structure elements that can vary in size across the image.
*
* ALTERNATIVE DESCRIPTION
* For an N-dimensional image, dt_f effectively computes the lower envelope
* of the spherical paraboloids of dimension N+1 with apexes at
* ( x1 ... xn f( ( x1 ...  xn ) ) )
*
* VORONOI MAP
* For the special case of dt_i, the paraboloids that participate in the
* lower envelope have their apexes on the foreground voxels. The voronoi
* map copies information from the apex abscissas to the whole region where
* the paraboloid is minimal. This information can be a label, a unique
* number, a position or anything else that is provided in a label map.
*
* TEMPLATE PARAMETERS
* \param TFunctionImage is mandatory. It is the first input to the filter
* and - in the wording of the alternative description above - effectively
* describes the height of all parabolas. When you use the filter as an
* alternative to DanielssonMapImageFilter, you need to provide an image
* that is 0 at foreground pixels and infinite ( i.e.
* GetMaximalSquaredDistance() ) at background pixels.
*
* \param TDistanceImage - is the type of the image that should hold the
* output.
* This type defaults to TFunctionImage, but you might need a larger data
* type in order to hold the squared distance to your foreground. For
* example, in a radiologic dataset with pixel type short, you would need a
* TDistanceImage with pixel type int to hold distances larger that 255.
*
* \param TLabelImage If voronoi maps are generated, which is disabled by
* default, you can specify the type of the label image as well. You can
* use any pixel type you like. This will be the type of label input and
* voronoi map output.
*
* \param MaximalSquaredDistance This is initialized by default to to half
* of the maximum value that TDistanceImage can hold in order to prevent
* overflows. You can get the value by calling GetMaximalSquaredDistance().
* You can also set a smaller value, i.e. to reinitialize the near band of a
* level set. The computation will be a little bit faster and you might also
* be able to use a smaller pixel type for TDistanceImage.
*
* \param CacheLineSize The length of one or two L1 cache lines on your
* platform.  On most current hardware, one line of L1 cache can hold either
* 64 or 128 bytes and you have probably 1024 lines per processor. If you
* set a value below your platforms cache line size, the performance will
* degrade considerably. Try 1 to see how the algorithm performs when the
* cache is not taken into account.
* If you select the exact cache line size of your hardware and all data
* types are allocated cache line aligned, then
* GeneralizedDistanceTransformImageFilter will utilize each cache line to
* its fullest. Choosing twice the cache line size will be more performant
* for non cache aligned data. Even larger values will probably degrade
* performance again, because the number of cache lines
* will be exhausted during computation
*
* USAGE TIPS
* If you need spacing of voronoi maps, you have to switch them on.
